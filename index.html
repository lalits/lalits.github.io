        		<h1>Hi! My name is Lalit Sharma, and I'm a programmer based in Hyderabad</h1>
				<p>I believe in creating castles in the air. Some call it programming.</p>
        <p>After receiving my Bachelor's degree in 2011 from PEC University of Technology, I joined a startup and honed my skills as a full stack developer. 
		For a year or so, I ran my own shop, developing enterprise software for SMEs and NGOs.
			I currently work with another startup, involved with autonomous, self-driving vehicles.</p>
        <p>Besides this, I love long distance cycling and mountaineering. I've travelled and hiked across Himalayas and the Western Ghats in India.</p>
